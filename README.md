TOP Recipes project

Before:
The purpose of this project is to practice the basic HTML skills I've learned from TOP. 

I will create a website with a main index page that will link to a few recipes. This is also an opportunity for me to practice with git and github VSC.

Eventually, I will style it with CSS.
