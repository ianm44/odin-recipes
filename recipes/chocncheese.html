        <h3>Descreepts</h3>
        <div class="text-of-pages">
            <p>Most audio historians point to Chocolate and Cheese as a groundbreaking album by the powerhouse band, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ween">Ween.</a> Formed in 1984 in Pennsylvania, Ween's discography takes the listener on a profound and eclectic journey. From funk, soul, gospel, R&B, to heavy metal, punk, prog, country, and of course psychedelia, Ween has developed a massive following over decades of honing their craft.</p>

            <p>Chocolate and cheese, much like the album, is a flavor profile full of contradictions. Ween wrote the album specifically to address the growing rift between chocoheads and cheesemongers: two sects of nuevo-Orwellian political thought provocateurs who disagreed on nearly every foundational principle of mathematical thinking. With some basic background, anyone can go back through the album to uncover the jarring juxtaposition between these two radical groups. </p>

            <p>With some oral accompaniment, it's possible to gain a deeply moving understanding of the conflict. With that, our recipe is below. Bare in mind as you create, research, disect, bleed: are you a chocohead or a cheesemonger?</p>
